that's"},{"start":"526.63","dur":"5.4","text":"gonna return an object"},{"start":"528.74","dur":"8.28","text":"and we're gonna define the next and"},{"start":"532.03","dur":"12.25","text":"that's

what"},{"start":"551.12","dur":"13.29","text":"calls plus plus and if stop then return"},{"start":"559.69","dur":"11.38","text":"so value person will just do this first"},{"start":"564.41","dur":"11.76","text":"actually will do object dot keys person"},{"start":"571.07","dur":"7.5","text":"and then we'll grab the BIA will

times"},{"start":"609.23","dur":"13.8","text":"it's been run so now if I look at person"},{"start":"615.08","dur":"9.54","text":"and look at symbol dot iterator you see"},{"start":"623.03","dur":"6.15","text":"it's actually has an X so it's"},{"start":"624.62","dur":"9.57","text":"essentially a iterator so we can do

to"},{"start":"678.57","dur":"6.12","text":"return I don't know let's say the actual"},{"start":"681.72","dur":"8.1","text":"value since to the keys then I could"},{"start":"684.69","dur":"11.79","text":"just change this value here to let's see"},{"start":"689.82","dur":"12.36","text":"we would go person and then this

five"},{"start":"704.37","dur":"5.61","text":"one two one two so we essentially took"},{"start":"708","dur":"4.2","text":"in this taking this person in a

a"},{"start":"739.89","dur":"9.75","text":"generator so we can do this a few ways"},{"start":"744.72","dur":"9.84","text":"so we'll go person and we'll do

for"},{"start":"1156.79","dur":"8.2","text":"constant p and you use this in operator"},{"start":"1161.03","dur":"6.33","text":"and then you just neat give it the

and actually no let's not even do"},{"start":"365.52","dur":"5.01","text":"that let's just say define bark like"},{"start":"368.699","dur":"5.28","text":"that and then what I'm gonna do in here"},{"start":"370.53","dur":"4.949","text":"is simply print work okay so what I've"},{"start":"373.979","dur":"3.421","text":"actually done here and I know this

to"},{"start":"409.15","dur":"5.34","text":"that so I'm gonna say D equals a dog"},{"start":"411.94","dur":"4.5","text":"down here and what I've done when I did"},{"start":"414.49","dur":"3.66","text":"this here is I'm actually saying okay"},{"start":"416.44","dur":"4.29","text":"I'm gonna have the variable D and

a"},{"start":"425.35","dur":"3.45","text":"second but when I write this line here"},{"start":"427.27","dur":"3.78","text":"and I put dog which is the name of

a"},{"start":"472.54","dur":"4.77","text":"dog and one of those operations is bark"},{"start":"475.06","dur":"3.9","text":"so this is a method remember we've"},{"start":"477.31","dur":"4.17","text":"talked to a method just like dot upper"},{"start":"478.96","dur":"5.73","text":"before so if I want to use that method"},{"start":"481.48","dur":"4.86","text":"on an instance of my dog class because"},{"start":"484.69","dur":"3.54","text":"this is an instance of the class dog"},{"start":"486.34","dur":"5.58","text":"then what I can do is I can type well"},{"start":"488.23","dur":"6.42","text":"not upper but dot bark like that so I"},{"start":"491.92","dur":"4.65","text":"can call this method on my dog object"},{"start":"494.65","dur":"4.44","text":"again because it is a class dog and I've"},{"start":"496.57","dur":"4.05","text":"defined a method that works for dogs so"},{"start":"499.09","dur":"3.66","text":"when I do that we can see that we get"},{"start":"500.62","dur":"3.96","text":"bark and then it still obviously"},{"start":"502.75","dur":"4.74","text":"continues to print the type of that"},{"start":"504.58","dur":"4.41","text":"object so this is what we're getting out"},{"start":"507.49","dur":"4.14","text":"here so these are kind of how classes"},{"start":"508.99","dur":"4.05","text":"work we name the class typically the"},{"start":"511.63","dur":"3.87","text":"convention is to use an uppercase letter"},{"start":"513.04","dur":"4.05","text":"and usually you go camel case so you do"},{"start":"515.5","dur":"3.72","text":"like dog like you say we're gonna do two"},{"start":"517.09","dur":"4.59","text":"words you do like dog hello right so"},{"start":"519.22","dur":"4.59","text":"camel case like that and then inside

few"},{"start":"525.28","dur":"4.68","text":"different methods and operations that"},{"start":"527.14","dur":"4.77","text":"can be performed by this object so what"},{"start":"529.96","dur":"4.02","text":"I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say define I"},{"start":"531.91","dur":"4.289","text":"don't know let's just say meow I know"},{"start":"533.98","dur":"3.81","text":"this is wrong because it's not a dog and"},{"start":"536.199","dur":"3.45","text":"we'll talk about self in just a minute"},{"start":"537.79","dur":"3.69","text":"but I can define another method here and"},{"start":"539.649","dur":"5.55","text":"instead of printing something I could"},{"start":"541.48","dur":"5.49","text":"say return let's just say yeah like that"},{"start":"545.199","dur":"3.45","text":"so I don't necessarily need to

so"},{"start":"550.3","dur":"4.86","text":"maybe I have meow and then I put X and"},{"start":"552.97","dur":"3.09","text":"maybe what I do is I return X plus 1 or"},{"start":"555.16","dur":"4.14","text":"something like that so maybe let's just"},{"start":"556.06","dur":"4.829","text":"call this add call this add underscore 1"},{"start":"559.3","dur":"3.479","text":"that'll be the name of our method so I"},{"start":"560.889","dur":"3.331","text":"can return X plus 1 and then what I"},{"start":"562.779","dur":"5.161","text":"could do if I want it here is like it's"},{"start":"564.22","dur":"5.52","text":"a dog add underscore 1 put 5 there and"},{"start":"567.94","dur":"4.709","text":"let's print out the value that we get"},{"start":"569.74","dur":"4.8","text":"let's have a look at this year and we"},{"start":"572.649","dur":"3.3","text":"can see that we get the value 6 so we"},{"start":"574.54","dur":"2.849","text":"can make methods that have different"},{"start":"575.949","dur":"3.601","text":"arguments associated with them or"},{"start":"577.389","dur":"3.601","text":"parameters like I've put X here and that"},{"start":"579.55","dur":"3.99","text":"just means that when I call that method"},{"start":"580.99","dur":"4.83","text":"I need to pass in a specific value or"},{"start":"583.54","dur":"4.919","text":"specific values so that that can operate"},{"start":"585.82","dur":"4.259","text":"and that can work so that is how the"},{"start":"588.459","dur":"3.091","text":"methods work so now we're gonna talk"},{"start":"590.079","dur":"3.211","text":"about itself but before we can do that"},{"start":"591.55","dur":"4.2","text":"we need to talk about what's called the"},{"start":"593.29","dur":"3.87","text":"anit method which you may have seen me"},{"start":"595.75","dur":"2.79","text":"typing at the beginning before I kind of"},{"start":"597.16","dur":"3.72","text":"gave up on X I didn't want to get that"},{"start":"598.54","dur":"4.68","text":"complex that fast so right now we have"},{"start":"600.88","dur":"4.139","text":"two methods we have this bark method and"},{"start":"603.22","dur":"3.479","text":"we have this add one method and I hope"},{"start":"605.019","dur":"3.151","text":"those makes sense on how those work and"},{"start":"606.699","dur":"3.33","text":"now we're gonna talk about this special"},{"start":"608.17","dur":"3.18","text":"method here and by the way this has two"},{"start":"610.029","dur":"3.841","text":"underscores so it has underscore"},{"start":"611.35","dur":"4.739","text":"underscore and then an it and then"},{"start":"613.87","dur":"4.409","text":"underscore underscore now this is a"},{"start":"616.089","dur":"4.411","text":"special method and what this pretty much"},{"start":"618.279","dur":"4.771","text":"allows us to do is instantiate the"},{"start":"620.5","dur":"5.19","text":"object right when it is created so this"},{"start":"623.05","dur":"4.74","text":"method will be called whenever we write"},{"start":"625.69","dur":"4.23","text":"this line so whenever we create a

down"},{"start":"631.42","dur":"5.159","text":"here for right now this method will be"},{"start":"633.819","dur":"4.051","text":"called and it will pass any arguments"},{"start":"636.579","dur":"4.351","text":"that we put in here so maybe I put"},{"start":"637.87","dur":"5.459","text":"something like Tim in here it will pass"},{"start":"640.93","dur":"4.44","text":"that to this method so let's say that"},{"start":"643.329","dur":"3.601","text":"every time we create a dog and we want"},{"start":"645.37","dur":"3.54","text":"to give it a name immediately so to"},{"start":"646.93","dur":"4.68","text":"create a dog the criteria is that you"},{"start":"648.91","dur":"5.669","text":"must give it a name well what we would"},{"start":"651.61","dur":"5.94","text":"do in here is we would put the parameter"},{"start":"654.579","dur":"5.37","text":"name and then here we would pass in the"},{"start":"657.55","dur":"4.26","text":"name so what we need to do though is"},{"start":"659.949","dur":"3.87","text":"what we're passing in this name we need"},{"start":"661.81","dur":"3.33","text":"to store this in the dog object"},{"start":"663.819","dur":"3.401","text":"somewhere right we need to have this"},{"start":"665.14","dur":"3.79","text":"stored we need to be able to access

gonna"},{"start":"670.13","dur":"4.32","text":"talk about attributes what we can do if"},{"start":"672.17","dur":"5.94","text":"we want to store this name is we can say"},{"start":"674.45","dur":"4.92","text":"self dot name equals name now it's"},{"start":"678.11","dur":"3.15","text":"important to note that this doesn't"},{"start":"679.37","dur":"3.48","text":"these don't need to match but what we've"},{"start":"681.26","dur":"4.23","text":"just done here is we've created what's"},{"start":"682.85","dur":"5.67","text":"called an attribute of the class dog"},{"start":"685.49","dur":"4.83","text":"which is name so what this means is"},{"start":"688.52","dur":"4.26","text":"essentially every time we create a new"},{"start":"690.32","dur":"4.65","text":"dog object we will pass a name through"},{"start":"692.78","dur":"4.92","text":"this parameter so self just stays here"},{"start":"694.97","dur":"4.77","text":"to denote the object itself so like"},{"start":"697.7","dur":"4.47","text":"every time one of these things is called"},{"start":"699.74","dur":"4.92","text":"we will pass a reference to which

talk"},{"start":"706.61","dur":"3.33","text":"about that more in a second but here"},{"start":"708.41","dur":"3.27","text":"what I've done is to find an attribute"},{"start":"709.94","dur":"4.05","text":"called name which is equal to the name"},{"start":"711.68","dur":"4.53","text":"that we passed in so what I'll do is"},{"start":"713.99","dur":"3.93","text":"immediately I'll just print inside of"},{"start":"716.21","dur":"3.75","text":"here the name so that we can see how"},{"start":"717.92","dur":"4.53","text":"this works and notice that when I run"},{"start":"719.96","dur":"4.2","text":"this now we get Tim printing out so even"},{"start":"722.45","dur":"4.17","text":"though I didn't explicitly call this an"},{"start":"724.16","dur":"4.86","text":"it method because I wrote this line here"},{"start":"726.62","dur":"4.62","text":"it passed this name that I put in here"},{"start":"729.02","dur":"4.14","text":"to the name parameter and then it"},{"start":"731.24","dur":"4.23","text":"printed out name here inside of the"},{"start":"733.16","dur":"5.97","text":"Anette and we also defined an attribute"},{"start":"735.47","dur":"6.27","text":"called name that is inside of this dog"},{"start":"739.13","dur":"4.41","text":"class so what self is doing is

we"},{"start":"768.86","dur":"4.35","text":"get Tim and we get Bill so we actually"},{"start":"770.78","dur":"4.68","text":"have two different dog objects now one"},{"start":"773.21","dur":"4.65","text":"named Tim and one named Bill and they"},{"start":"775.46","dur":"3.57","text":"both store different names inside

show how this attribute"},{"start":"782.87","dur":"3.6","text":"works so the point of this attribute is"},{"start":"784.52","dur":"3.72","text":"that it's stored permanently for each"},{"start":"786.47","dur":"4.17","text":"specific object so I can actually go"},{"start":"788.24","dur":"4.41","text":"ahead and go down here and print D dot"},{"start":"790.64","dur":"6.81","text":"name after that's defined and I can"},{"start":"792.65","dur":"6.63","text":"print D - dot name like that and when we"},{"start":"797.45","dur":"3.18","text":"look here we can see that those names"},{"start":"799.28","dur":"2.97","text":"get printed out so Tim and Bill"},{"start":"800.63","dur":"3.96","text":"notice that I remove the print statement"},{"start":"802.25","dur":"4.32","text":"from up here so these attributes when we"},{"start":"804.59","dur":"3.24","text":"do something like a self dot and then"},{"start":"806.57","dur":"2.85","text":"anything that we want we can call"},{"start":"807.83","dur":"3.93","text":"whatever we want is equal to some value"},{"start":"809.42","dur":"4.17","text":"we can reference them later on and

is"},{"start":"815.87","dur":"5.07","text":"something like say define get underscore"},{"start":"818.87","dur":"4.11","text":"name so the first argument here is"},{"start":"820.94","dur":"3.72","text":"always gonna be self are the first"},{"start":"822.98","dur":"3.75","text":"parameter and the reason for that is"},{"start":"824.66","dur":"4.68","text":"because we need to invisibly pass the"},{"start":"826.73","dur":"4.62","text":"actual you know dog object itself so"},{"start":"829.34","dur":"4.32","text":"that we know which dog were accessing"},{"start":"831.35","dur":"4.59","text":"when we're gonna get say the name of the"},{"start":"833.66","dur":"4.34","text":"dog so here we're gonna say define get"},{"start":"835.94","dur":"4.65","text":"name and all we're gonna do is

thought"},{"start":"842.99","dur":"3.27","text":"get underscore name which is a method"},{"start":"844.61","dur":"4.74","text":"right and we can do that down here as"},{"start":"846.26","dur":"6.06","text":"well get underscore name and then we see"},{"start":"849.35","dur":"4.65","text":"that we get Tim and we get Bill so that"},{"start":"852.32","dur":"3.33","text":"is the basics behind objects now of"},{"start":"854","dur":"3.75","text":"course I can make more attributes as"},{"start":"855.65","dur":"3.6","text":"well so I could do something like H so"},{"start":"857.75","dur":"4.65","text":"let's say my dogs I want them to have a"},{"start":"859.25","dur":"6.09","text":"name so let's say my dogs want them to"},{"start":"862.4","dur":"4.41","text":"have a name and an age well what I'll do"},{"start":"865.34","dur":"3.45","text":"now is I'll say okay so in our"},{"start":"866.81","dur":"4.35","text":"initialization for dog we're going to"},{"start":"868.79","dur":"4.44","text":"take a name and we're gonna take an H so"},{"start":"871.16","dur":"3.78","text":"we'll define the attributes in here so"},{"start":"873.23","dur":"4.74","text":"self dot age is equal to whatever age

one"},{"start":"884.12","dur":"4.38","text":"and we'll run this and we see that we"},{"start":"886.52","dur":"3.42","text":"get no issue and if I wanted to I can go"},{"start":"888.5","dur":"5.76","text":"ahead and define another method here so"},{"start":"889.94","dur":"6.69","text":"get age and we'll return self dot age"},{"start":"894.26","dur":"5.88","text":"like that and if we change this to get"},{"start":"896.63","dur":"6.99","text":"inch and we change this one down here

and"},{"start":"1234.92","dur":"3.75","text":"that should be good for our students so"},{"start":"1237.08","dur":"3.06","text":"we could of course go in here and add"},{"start":"1238.67","dur":"3.69","text":"some methods if we wanted something like"},{"start":"1240.14","dur":"4.05","text":"get underscore grade and what does ID 1"},{"start":"1242.36","dur":"5.19","text":"just so we have it in here and what we"},{"start":"1244.19","dur":"5.64","text":"can do is return a self duck grade

for"},{"start":"1582.96","dur":"8.08","text":"student in in this case self dot"},{"start":"1586.54","dur":"8.91","text":"students then we're gonna say value plus"},{"start":"1591.04","dur":"6.48","text":"equals student the duck gets grade like"},{"start":"1595.45","dur":"4.77","text":"that now notice that we could just type"},{"start":"1597.52","dur":"4.32","text":"great if we wanted to but I usually just"},{"start":"1600.22","dur":"3.39","text":"like to use the method because say"},{"start":"1601.84","dur":"4.38","text":"we were to change any attribute later"},{"start":"1603.61","dur":"3.929","text":"then this code wouldn't break so long as"},{"start":"1606.22","dur":"3.089","text":"this method was still named the same"},{"start":"1607.539","dur":"3.781","text":"thing and we can modify the method in"},{"start":"1609.309","dur":"3.48","text":"here so they returned the proper grade"},{"start":"1611.32","dur":"4.05","text":"like say we had a student enrolled

that"},{"start":"1643.21","dur":"3.39","text":"and we can see that the average grade is"},{"start":"1644.74","dur":"3.84","text":"actually 85 and that makes sense

that's"},{"start":"1672.19","dur":"3.18","text":"something that we could do now let's"},{"start":"1673.72","dur":"3.48","text":"just look at what happens when I decide"},{"start":"1675.37","dur":"4.98","text":"to try to add that third student so"},{"start":"1677.2","dur":"5.729","text":"course start add student like that and"},{"start":"1680.35","dur":"4.949","text":"we decide to add student s3 we can see"},{"start":"1682.929","dur":"3.6","text":"that we get the value false and notice"},{"start":"1685.299","dur":"4.291","text":"that the average grade does not change"},{"start":"1686.529","dur":"5.37","text":"because we didn't actually add that

second"},{"start":"1715.149","dur":"5.28","text":"is you have two classes that are very"},{"start":"1717.58","dur":"5.52","text":"similar so let's say we have a general"},{"start":"1720.429","dur":"3.781","text":"class called maybe alright let's do a"},{"start":"1723.1","dur":"3.51","text":"better example let's say we have a class"},{"start":"1724.21","dur":"3.839","text":"called dog and a class called cat and in"},{"start":"1726.61","dur":"3.6","text":"fact let's actually code these out so"},{"start":"1728.049","dur":"3.87","text":"that we can see this for real so let's"},{"start":"1730.21","dur":"3.06","text":"say in the init method of the cat what"},{"start":"1731.919","dur":"2.531","text":"we're gonna do is we're gonna have self"},{"start":"1733.27","dur":"2.89","text":"name"},{"start":"1734.45","dur":"5.97","text":"and age like that so we're going to say"},{"start":"1736.16","dur":"5.88","text":"you know self dot name equals if I can"},{"start":"1740.42","dur":"3.87","text":"type properly which apparently is not"},{"start":"1742.04","dur":"5.31","text":"happening right now and then self dot"},{"start":"1744.29","dur":"6.6","text":"age and then we'll do define speak and"},{"start":"1747.35","dur":"5.76","text":"all we'll do in here is just print you"},{"start":"1750.89","dur":"3.42","text":"know what is this cat yeah okay and then"},{"start":"1753.11","dur":"4.86","text":"let's say we have a dog"},{"start":"1754.31","dur":"5.07","text":"so we'll say class dog like that and"},{"start":"1757.97","dur":"3.75","text":"we'll define underscore underscore net"},{"start":"1759.38","dur":"4.05","text":"on our squander square put the self put"},{"start":"1761.72","dur":"3.15","text":"the name put the age because that's all"},{"start":"1763.43","dur":"7.29","text":"we want for that and we'll say self dot"},{"start":"1764.87","dur":"8.22","text":"name equals name self dot age equals age"},{"start":"1770.72","dur":"4.05","text":"and then define here speak and the only"},{"start":"1773.09","dur":"3.72","text":"difference between these two classes is"},{"start":"1774.77","dur":"6.06","text":"actually gonna be the fact that this"},{"start":"1776.81","dur":"5.22","text":"prints bark instead of meow so notice"},{"start":"1780.83","dur":"2.7","text":"that these two classes are almost"},{"start":"1782.03","dur":"2.82","text":"identical in fact there's only one

there"},{"start":"1787.01","dur":"3.3","text":"must be a way that we don't need to"},{"start":"1788.72","dur":"3.54","text":"write this twice that we can actually"},{"start":"1790.31","dur":"4.23","text":"use what's called inheritance so that"},{"start":"1792.26","dur":"4.44","text":"these dog and these cat classes can well"},{"start":"1794.54","dur":"3.69","text":"inherit from an upper level class which"},{"start":"1796.7","dur":"4.14","text":"means that all that functionality is"},{"start":"1798.23","dur":"4.05","text":"defined in one place and we only need to"},{"start":"1800.84","dur":"3.36","text":"write what's different about those two"},{"start":"1802.28","dur":"3.66","text":"classes inside of them so ideally what I"},{"start":"1804.2","dur":"3.42","text":"would like to have is to be able to"},{"start":"1805.94","dur":"3.6","text":"remove this init class from both of"},{"start":"1807.62","dur":"3.99","text":"these and just have the speak method"},{"start":"1809.54","dur":"3.63","text":"because the only thing that's specific"},{"start":"1811.61","dur":"3.03","text":"to a cat in a dog at least for my"},{"start":"1813.17","dur":"3.9","text":"example is the fact that one of them"},{"start":"1814.64","dur":"4.26","text":"says meow and one of them says bark so"},{"start":"1817.07","dur":"5.67","text":"let's get show how we can actually do"},{"start":"1818.9","dur":"7.08","text":"them so by removing that you know was an"},{"start":"1822.74","dur":"5.22","text":"it method and just having these methods"},{"start":"1825.98","dur":"3.33","text":"here what we need to do is make an upper"},{"start":"1827.96","dur":"4.77","text":"level class which I'm actually gonna"},{"start":"1829.31","dur":"4.95","text":"call pet so I'm gonna say class pet what"},{"start":"1832.73","dur":"3.42","text":"I'm gonna do in here is define that an"},{"start":"1834.26","dur":"5.4","text":"it method that we had before I'm"},{"start":"1836.15","dur":"5.67","text":"actually gonna define a let's say show"},{"start":"1839.66","dur":"4.62","text":"so this show method is just gonna show"},{"start":"1841.82","dur":"4.41","text":"me all the things about my objects so"},{"start":"1844.28","dur":"3.6","text":"I'm gonna say print and in here

then"},{"start":"2759.86","dur":"4.53","text":"what we're gonna do right here is return"},{"start":"2761.33","dur":"5.73","text":"CLS number of people and we're gonna

a"},{"start":"2778.46","dur":"5.46","text":"little bit weird but the idea behind"},{"start":"2780.14","dur":"6.45","text":"this is this method here is not going to"},{"start":"2783.92","dur":"4.26","text":"be acting on behalf of one instance it's"},{"start":"2786.59","dur":"3.51","text":"not gonna be specific to an instance

going"},{"start":"2791.72","dur":"5.149","text":"to be very effective what this is meant"},{"start":"2794.27","dur":"4.249","text":"to do is be called on the class

that's"},{"start":"2809.95","dur":"5.399","text":"why I've written CLS here instead of"},{"start":"2812.349","dur":"5.4","text":"self because there's no object what it's"},{"start":"2815.349","dur":"4.23","text":"doing is just acting on this class so"},{"start":"2817.749","dur":"3.691","text":"for example say we wanted to add to the"},{"start":"2819.579","dur":"6.331","text":"number of people then what I could say"},{"start":"2821.44","dur":"9.51","text":"is class method define add person

that"},{"start":"2842.41","dur":"3.659","text":"they're referencing the class so let's"},{"start":"2844.839","dur":"3.571","text":"actually have a look at how we use that"},{"start":"2846.069","dur":"4.26","text":"now sure need to necessarily print the"},{"start":"2848.41","dur":"4.649","text":"number of people anymore what we can do"},{"start":"2850.329","dur":"5.101","text":"is we can go down here and say person"},{"start":"2853.059","dur":"4.2","text":"dot number of people and I don't know"},{"start":"2855.43","dur":"3.839","text":"why there's so many brackets showing up"},{"start":"2857.259","dur":"4.05","text":"there geez but if we look at this uh"},{"start":"2859.269","dur":"4.29","text":"what we would need to print it out first"},{"start":"2861.309","dur":"6.18","text":"we should hopefully get the value of 2"},{"start":"2863.559","dur":"5.97","text":"so let's look okay so we need to rename"},{"start":"2867.489","dur":"3.151","text":"this so that this is not the same as the"},{"start":"2869.529","dur":"2.46","text":"attribute because that's gonna be"},{"start":"2870.64","dur":"2.879","text":"confusing so let's add an underscore"},{"start":"2871.989","dur":"3.03","text":"there because I was realizing what the"},{"start":"2873.519","dur":"3.871","text":"heck what's going on there and we can"},{"start":"2875.019","dur":"4.8","text":"see that we get 0 oh so that is because"},{"start":"2877.39","dur":"4.439","text":"I did not continue to add here so"},{"start":"2879.819","dur":"3.151","text":"actually what I'm gonna do is and this"},{"start":"2881.829","dur":"3.42","text":"actually be a good example so let's"},{"start":"2882.97","dur":"4.529","text":"illustrate this here is I wanted to say"},{"start":"2885.249","dur":"4.201","text":"too but I forgot that I forgot you know"},{"start":"2887.499","dur":"3.721","text":"didn't continue adding this but what I"},{"start":"2889.45","dur":"3.96","text":"can do is actually use the class method"},{"start":"2891.22","dur":"6.299","text":"that I've defined here to add a person"},{"start":"2893.41","dur":"6","text":"so I can say person dot add person like"},{"start":"2897.519","dur":"3.871","text":"that inside of my in it and what that"},{"start":"2899.41","dur":"4.26","text":"will do is call the class method on the"},{"start":"2901.39","dur":"3.869","text":"class person and then it will add to the"},{"start":"2903.67","dur":"3.899","text":"number of people so now when we run that"},{"start":"2905.259","dur":"2.911","text":"we get two so that is how a class method"},{"start":"2907.569","dur":"2.67","text":"works"},{"start":"2908.17","dur":"3.689","text":"I don't need access to the instance to"},{"start":"2910.239","dur":"3.691","text":"call it although I can use an instance"},{"start":"2911.859","dur":"3.871","text":"to call it if I want I can simply"},{"start":"2913.93","dur":"4.379","text":"reference the actual name of the class"},{"start":"2915.73","dur":"4.5","text":"and this does not access any

together"},{"start":"2934.579","dur":"4.381","text":"so for example you know when you say"},{"start":"2936.29","dur":"4.26","text":"like import math like that and then you"},{"start":"2938.96","dur":"4.35","text":"get access to all these math functions"},{"start":"2940.55","dur":"4.25","text":"like math dot abs or math dot square"},{"start":"2943.31","dur":"4.38","text":"roots or whatever it is you're gonna use"},{"start":"2944.8","dur":"4.36","text":"well what they sometimes end up doing

one"},{"start":"2954.53","dur":"6.15","text":"like this yeah I would do something you"},{"start":"2957.47","dur":"4.47","text":"define add two like this well what you"},{"start":"2960.68","dur":"3.3","text":"want to do is you want to actually"},{"start":"2961.94","dur":"3.45","text":"organize them into a class and

them"},{"start":"2970.67","dur":"4.23","text":"and to do something like this you want"},{"start":"2972.589","dur":"5.341","text":"to use what's called a static method now"},{"start":"2974.9","dur":"4.679","text":"let's make a class called math and what"},{"start":"2977.93","dur":"3.99","text":"I'm gonna do in here is I'm gonna

class"},{"start":"2995.69","dur":"3.27","text":"or not I would like to be able to use"},{"start":"2997.13","dur":"4.62","text":"them so what I'm gonna do is actually"},{"start":"2998.96","dur":"5.34","text":"create what's called a static method now"},{"start":"3001.75","dur":"4.65","text":"static means not changing right it
