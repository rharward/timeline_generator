00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
Hey guys, welcome back to Middle Ground.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.260
Before we jump in we've got a huge announcement.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.040
A lot of folks have been asking for this for years.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.040
We're finally giving you the first-ever Jubilee podcast called 'radical empathy'.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.140
That's right,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.360
we are really proud and excited to share it with you guys.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.860
It actually features an interview with somebody in this episode,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.600
so stick around till the end and we'll tell you more about it.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.280
For now, enjoy the episode

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.640
I don't think, I know for a fact it's a globe.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
The Earth is flat.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.380
It's like we have this picture of reality that's a big puzzle piece,

00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:06.800
and then one of those pieces just wasn't fitting.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.860
I'm always open to having a discussion with someone

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.480
who is holding a

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.540
wrong belief like this.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.180
I'm not.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.340
The evidence is so much.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.760
Nobody wants to be a flat earther,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.380
but if you showed me

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.840
incontrovertible evidence,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.270
I would definitely go back.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.300
Who wants the ridicule?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.100
I'd like to tear them to pieces.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.460
I'm Jim Underdown,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.020
executive director of the Center for Inquiry West in Los Angeles and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.160
the chair of the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.740
CFI investigations group

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.980
I'm Spencer Marks,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.005
one of the senior members of the CFI investigations group,

00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:00.840
science advocate.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.600
I am Ali Nayeri,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.360
I'm a theoretical physicist and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.640
I'm with the University of Irvine.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.800
I am Wendell Walton.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.700
I am a chief learning officer for a young startup.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.260
I'm Shelly Lewis.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.331
I'm a graduate of West Point, critical thinker

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:18.200
and jumped out of airplanes.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.800
My name is Dan Glatman.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.300
I work as Dan the Water Man in the drinking water filtration industry,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.960
and I'm a truth seeker.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.240
Well, I've been a Christian for thirty years, so

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.870
The Bible is a Flat Earth book.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.600
You have to take it literally.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.169
Like for example in Isaiah

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.344
when it talks about how the earth

00:02:59.344 --> 00:03:02.420
is like a clay wet wax seal

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.520
that stamped with upturned edges.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.400
That's just not some fancy story.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.080
That's a simile: "it is like".

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.120
[Shelly]: Right, absolutely, and in Isaiah talks about too - and I'm a Christian -

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.100
He who sits upon the circle of the earth.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.479
There's a difference between a circle and a ball.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.340
Well, exactly, if you look at the original

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.720
Hebrew it means "disk". There's over 200 scriptures in the Bible that point to a Flat Earth

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.440
So this notion that you need God or some higher power

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.120
to create the Earth or the universe is very old

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.300
and was initially

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.000
posited by people of a pre-scientific age.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.280
Since then, we have learned quite a bit about

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.160
the universe coming into existence when that happened.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.758
Modern humans don't get their cosmology,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.660
they don't get their physics,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.477
they don't get their knowledge of the universe

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.620
from the Bible or any ancient text.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.400
It's sort of like the God of the Gaps.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.959
Once you know people used to believe that

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.540
lightning was God's wrath and throwing these lightning bolts,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.820
but once we understood it was a natural process

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.160
God shrank a little bit more

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.740
because now we couldn't attribute those lightning bolts to God,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.720
we had to attribute that to the real science.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.040
And the other thing

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.520
to the point about the Bible specifically for me is

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.759
why is that one particular text the correct one. You choose

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.000
to believe that, and that's fine, but

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.900
there's so many other writings and so many other books.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.099
So why weren't they correct? Why is just the the Bible, correct?

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.979
Well what you'll find in a lot of these ancient religions

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.550
is they're all flat earth religions.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.140
All their cosmology goes back to being a flat earth with an enclosed system.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.540
So it's not just the Bible that teaches this.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.640
It's many different religious books.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.160
So one problem I have is to uh- trying to explain

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.500
phenomena happen in nature

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.000
by holy books.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.923
Those are religious books.

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:10.620
Those are not books of science, and it is wrong to

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.940
infer or deduct

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.180
scientific readings out of those books.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.380
My name is Wendell, I am a

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.820
logical, biblically-based and scientific Flat Earther.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.720
I didn't start out and no one starts out as a Flat Earther,

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.650
but I had a lot of questions

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.620
So I actually got to the point where I had to go out and and put my own eyeballs on it

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.370
So we went out to an observation at Salton Sea and

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.800
Things just didn't add up down there.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.700
So we've gone back

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.160
Probably a dozen times and

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.536
I can guarantee you that

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:49.600
there is no curvature over distance.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.760
We have the advantage of information today that's outside of Channels 2, 4 and 7

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.520
and the few networks that are corporately owned.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.260
It's pretty easy to say

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.320
YouTube isn't research

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.000
but when you spend enough time,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.920
you're picking up quite a bit and

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.480
with the discussion groups, panels

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.440
We've gone against opposition, we've opposed ourselves

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.260
Surprisingly enough flat earth is its own worst enemy

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.669
so it's not that easy for us to come to consensus

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.780
and we find that consensus is orchestrated and not

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.960
actually scientific in any way.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.660
You know, my grandfather used to tell me growing up

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.700
never believe anything you read in the newspaper.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.200
Right?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.340
He told that to me.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.280
Now what the age of the Internet it's like, you know

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.809
How much of this misinformation are you getting there?

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:52.240
And when you have like eyewitnesses taking video of something,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.280
you do have to take everything with a grain of salt

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.799
That's why because of my um, my multimedia background

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.080
I knew that all that stuff could be faked,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.520
you know, take it into Photoshop.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.440
Take it into After Effects

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.220
Ok, this is at the core of the issue

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.483
of why there are so many Flat Earth believers

00:07:14.483 --> 00:07:15.860
out there right now.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.700
The problem is

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.500
the information from someone who decides to

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.120
Start a website

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.973
or produce a YouTube video is not reliable.

00:07:24.973 --> 00:07:27.760
When I have a toothache I go to a dentist,

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.280
My car breaks down, I go to a mechanic.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.840
When you have questions about cosmology

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.020
You should go to an astrophysicist.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.697
You should go to a physicist.

00:07:36.697 --> 00:07:39.820
You should go to people who have spent years and years

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:42.680
studying these ideas,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.309
not some 6 minute YouTube video

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.060
There is a percentage of people

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.900
that if they saw a youtube video that

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.600
was not within their scientific chops to refute on the face of it

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.920
would believe anything out there.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.900
One of the things I will say

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.600
is nasa.gov

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.020
has their own documents out there that

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.580
we get to vet

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.800
Which is through the Freedom of Information Act

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.880
and would you agree that NASA Documents

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.827
if they're on display that we should be able to go

00:08:10.827 --> 00:08:12.300
and research inside there

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.520
NASA is not proving that the earth is flat

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.660
Well they say it in [inaudible] documents

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.140
Well you should read what NASA says

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.780
and you should listen to what NASA says.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.500
I would love to see your NASA

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.620
evidence that the earth is flat.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.140
It's only they're contradictory issues that bring us here

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.840
We're all familiar with the earth rise photo,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.340
right?

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.473
The earth is rising over the moon.

00:08:31.473 --> 00:08:32.340
We're all familiar with it

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.001
It's NASA. You can go out to the NASA site.

00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:35.430
You can download the original, right?

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.910
I already know what you're gonna ask.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:37.410
So

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.459
You bring up the luminance on it and you can see where it's cut out and pasted there

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.550
They're showing us doctored images that are clearly doctored

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.000
The Blue Marble is a very famous image from 1972

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.809
when you talk to the artist from NASA

00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:53.460
His name's Robert Simmon.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.360
He talks about exactly how it was created from data,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.440
and it's not a photograph whatsoever

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.320
He added clouds, he added highlights.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.460
You take you know on your phone most phones have that panoramic image

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.980
When you do that you're taking a series of picture

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.540
and the phone cleverly stitches that together

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.440
I'm just saying how it's presented. It's presented as a real photograph.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.402
So when NASA takes real Photos and they either clean them up for color

00:09:17.402 --> 00:09:20.220
or they stitch them together. So it's one large image

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.700
It doesn't mean they're CGI.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.339
You're talking about composites

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.050
I'm what you call a globe denier

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.999
You could even get me into a virtual construct if I can't find the w- the borders myself

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.060
It appears to me to be a stationary plane

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.440
as opposed to the vastness of infinity of space

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.620
I would find it to be an ice plane

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.977
where we have a localized sun

00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:50.569
and our environment thrives there.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:55.340
You know these these particular people have misled us on television

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.100
This is a brilliant opportunity to speak.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.340
We've been suppressed,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.580
censored by mainstream media

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.520
Alternative media is that's just a thing of beauty for me

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.140
I'm running

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.240
Well, they uh they certainly think they're educated.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.300
And they're following

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.020
quite a bit of the university system what we call scientism

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.500
Right, scientism.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.000
obviously is the belief in what's

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.900
what's written.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.760
Where we tend to be exploring in the field with

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.620
physical properties.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.240
Not theories of any kind we're using actual measurements

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.309
That are calculated not by our guidelines, but the guidelines of science as we know it

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.910
I can only hope they're uneducated as opposed to disingenuous

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:50.540
well

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.540
That's the other thing too because we know that

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.840
It was on a large scale the government has been disingenuous

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.479
and they're, they're pushing a narrative, right?

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.800
So it's, it's hard for us.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.820
I mean, I'm sure that you've met people too

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.400
It's like look, are you just you haven't looked into it yet, or are you a shill?

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.880
Are you - Are you part of a disinformation campaign?

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.280
I don't think you guys are uneducated,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.460
I think you're wrongly educated

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.720
I think the problem with

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.360
what I've seen in the Flat Earth crowd is that

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:24.240
it's not that they're under-educated, but they

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.360
Instead of looking at evidence and letting the evidence guide to where the ultimate conclusion is

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.360
They start with a conclusion

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.840
and then they try to cherry-pick evidence to support their pre-drawn conclusion

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.189
They cast away all the bits of evidence that actually is contrary to their beliefs

00:11:40.189 --> 00:11:43.580
I think that you're very well educated as well as you are Jim

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.160
Certainly Ali is, he's probably got the best education of all of us

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.300
Exactly, and he paid for it, too.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.680
But more and more

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.391
professionals are coming on board.

00:11:53.391 --> 00:11:55.159
They're starting to question their reality

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.000
So the thing of it is is once you start to

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.840
really look

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.420
take a hard look at the evidence and you are

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.629
unafraid of just standing for the truth wherever that may lead you

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.660
then people end up becoming flat earthers.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.680
I'm hoping to be able to tell

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.700
our side of the story from the inside out.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.940
So many times

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:25.260
Flat earthers are depicted from the outside in and I want to be able to share with others

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.079
empirical data that proves the earth is not what we've been told.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.500
So when I was 12 years old,

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.820
I went to Space Camp

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.640
and I met Alan B. Shepard, (Wendell: ohh, nice)

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.340
Yep, yep,

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.079
and I wanted to be an astronaut and I wanted

00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:50.580
to be the first woman to walk the moon.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.662
So for me, I'm a glober.

00:12:53.662 --> 00:12:56.500
I went into this completely

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.240
wanting it to be true

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.240
and my husband told me he saw this thing about the fake moon landing.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.620
And I was like, you're absolutely crazy.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.449
There's no way that the moon landings are fake and then in 2010

00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:15.880
My husband was killed and so I never really developed that until around

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:22.220
2014 when Flat Earth kind of came back up and that...sorry... and that little voice inside my head

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.380
Said: remember the fake moon landings, remember when?

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.080
That was brought to my attention

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.400
and then I started really critically analyzing that and I would say

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.490
You know just looking at that evidence if they can lie about the moon landings

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.980
They can certainly lie about pictures and satellites

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.940
and other things than so. I started going down that rabbit hole of

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.880
Studying so that was my influence from my husband.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.960
How many lies does it take to make a liar, right?

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.980
And being ridiculed for being inquistive

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.260
Is pretty tough on us

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.100
I wouldn't say that I've changed my mind because my mind isn't set.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.160
NASA is, is solely designed to change my mind

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.360
It is from its inception from its discovery has been a television program

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.120
It's been a space program to sell us

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.710
on something that they've yet to actually show us

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:17.843
Show me a globe spinning with clouds and a moon.

00:14:17.843 --> 00:14:19.239
Show me home

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.180
And I think I could shut up quite easily

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.000
I think I could shut up.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.240
The timing of your conversions is interesting to me.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.390
20 years ago

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.150
the flat earth

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.600
world

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.520
was tiny and insignificant

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:46.360
Enter the advent of the internet - YouTube, online discussion groups, all these new

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.160
available places where you could find information about everything

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.260
This is true that

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:56.298
The evidences you looked were not robust evidence

00:14:56.298 --> 00:14:58.179
and the sources you used

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.140
They were not reliable sources again.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.560
But my problem is that,

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.660
and I like you guys that you are very skeptical,

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:11.500
but at the same time you're not skeptical about your belief system that should come first.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.580
You think that that's my foundation for why I believe the earth is flat and I'm telling you you're wrong

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.280
I have evidence that proves it's flat.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.143
What type of evidence?

00:15:20.143 --> 00:15:21.280
That proves that's not a ball

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.251
We're being misled,

00:15:23.251 --> 00:15:26.520
we're being deliberately less- misled by mainstream media,

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.820
No, what's your evidence?

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.100
We see too far.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.820
We see too far.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.240
We should not be able to see-

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.220
I live in Dana Point

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.360
Okay--

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.940
I can see San Clemente Island, which is 60 miles away

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.220
So what? (That is pretty high)

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:43.820
What do you mean "so what"? [Well, I'm on the beach] (It's 11 hundred feet tall) [I'm on the beach]

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.820
Can you see a ship which is going?

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.079
Oh yeah let's talk about the ship that goes over the curvature of the earth, I love that

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:54.759
Science has said that when I see a ship go out of my field of view

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.859
It's going over the curvature of the earth, correct?

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:01.640
Yes. SHELLEY: But then I bring my p900 up and guess what, I can zoom it back in

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.780
so is it going over the curvature of the earth or not?

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.860
Absolutely. Oh not all the time?

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.200
You don't see all the ship. The bottom part of the ship is hidden by the curvature.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.380
At that distance you shouldn't see the top of it either.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.290
If the earth were truly flat

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.740
There would be really hardly any limit,

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.370
you would be able to stand at the top of the Empire State Building and look toward Chicago

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.179
a mere thousand miles away, and see the lights of Chicago at night

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:27.179
No. Why wouldn't you? No because you have an atmospheric disturbance.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.480
It's very thick.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.200
I, I've been to astronomy since I was 10.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.400
It's faulty logic. It's completely faulty logic

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.760
One of the big things I do is investigate

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.380
extraordinary claims like flat eartherism or

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.860
ESP or all sorts of different things

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.460
The earth is undoubtedly a globe and not flat.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.520
This is well supported by gobs of science.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.940
What is the question? I don't understand the question.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.040
"Scientific consensus is possible"

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.040
Possible anything is possible.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.480
I mean anything is possible

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.640
I've got a, I've got a tremendous issue

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.460
with consensus and peer review.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.320
I've been spending a lot of time

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.200
Arguing the other, with people that argue the other side

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.040
And I found that surprisingly consensus always wins

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.300
it was shocking to me that the group with the majority has an incredible advantage

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:41.020
As scientists, flat-earthers, truthers, punks

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.860
We're at incredible disadvantage.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.720
Let's talk about scientific consensus for a second

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.440
You're never going to get a hundred percent of anyone

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.940
There is scientific consensus on a global earth,

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.560
there's scientific consensus on evolution

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.882
A lot of big issues.

00:17:56.882 --> 00:17:58.180
They use the word theory

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.300
Do you know what a theory in science is an extremely

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.900
Dan: And a fact is a fact

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.640
Don't mistake this word theory.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.600
In science. It's not conjecture. It's an explanation

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.760
By definition it's an explanation

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.180
So this is something people maybe mistake they think theory is..

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:23.620
In science the word theory is the highest level that you can give something because it's so well supported

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.978
What about a fact?

00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:26.029
That is a fact.

00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:28.900
It's not a fact you would call it a fact.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.420
You know, why? Do you know why?

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.140
Because in science, there's always room for improvement

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.290
There's always room to find better, to tweak, and find better information.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.540
So that is how science works.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.480
It gets better refined over time

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.740
as opposed to Flat Earth Theory

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:43.679
which never gets refined

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.440
it simply is what it is.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.960
New ideas have limited access to media

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.180
And limited exposure until we're in US University curriculums.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.040
We will continue to appear uneducated

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.000
Well, that's not true.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.180
In the history of science we had many occasions that it, the ideas

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.609
It was not welcomed by the society

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.660
Iceland was one of them. Galileo. Galileo was one of them,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.349
but if your theory is an authentic one and

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.120
It can be go through this hardship of scientific method

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:20.910
eventually, will win.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.460
I used to believe that

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.609
Science was after the truth, right?

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.770
They just we all just want to know what the truth is

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:34.340
Science has been trying so hard to divorce itself from the idea of a creator

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.880
When God's intent was to create science to lead you to him, you know

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.499
Sometimes things seem supernatural that we are able to explain

00:19:42.499 --> 00:19:44.309
later through, you know science

00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:45.560
Okay, understand.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.660
But there are other things as well that are supernatural,

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.780
that go beyond the natural, that we can always explain

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.185
Through believing in a creator, right?

00:19:55.185 --> 00:19:57.360
This is my big issue with science

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.980
Scientific approach and non scientific approach.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.579
You are absolutely right, in science

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.559
We are after the truth and we are hoping by each day

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:10.480
We're getting closer and closer to the truth.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.927
We never get there, never.

00:20:11.927 --> 00:20:13.709
Well, I know that's true for you.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.340
No, no that's just science.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.060
That's-- that's you guys,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.420
you think you do have the truth

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.730
Now, let's look at the evidences as you were mentioning.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.220
You do have the conclusion

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.120
Let's find the evidence.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.880
This-- science doesn't work that way

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.440
That's not true. That is not true-

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.820
Well you're saying, you're referring to Jesus, who many

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.160
Billions of people do not believe, including myself.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.802
And many more billions do.

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:38.353
So what? So who's right?

00:20:38.353 --> 00:20:39.580
Of course I cannot-

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.830
When you say that

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.840
We start with a conclusion and then try to match everything to make it work,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.370
like that to me is complete dishonesty

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.180
That is not true at all.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.120
That is what you are doing right now

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.660
No, you're not

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.360
You're making that assumption. No it's not my assumption

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.920
So do you make assumptions or not?

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.840
Does science make assumptions?

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.760
Does science make assumptions?

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.820
No, we're sure

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:04.660
we do make assumption but based on things that are well supported and proven

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.440
and reproven.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:13.100
Show me how you isolate gravity if gravity is an assumption, show me the scientific method

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.100
how you isolate gravity?

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.100
[inaudible]

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.680
I kind of feel like I want to develop some of this stuff a little bit more

00:21:39.689 --> 00:21:41.994
It feels high-level, but I feel like there's so much

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.900
that I haven't really even touched base on.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.560
Well, I mean I

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.880
Certainly didn't think that anybody was gonna the side was gonna flip.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.220
Well, there's still time

00:21:50.429 --> 00:21:53.788
There's still time I have hope for you Wendller and Shelley I don't know about Dan

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.200
But you know, it's certainly

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.140
I'm glad it's a civil discussion certainly oh, yeah

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.140
He flipped!

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.360
The greatest moment in television history

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.171
So, I mean,

00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:31.480
obviously any organization can be wrong

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.980
with certain things and they

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.960
may have individuals

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.240
that lie or deceive

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:37.880
or something.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.840
But as a general organization

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.540
They're looking for the truth.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:48.240
Yeah, the idea that NASA and the government is lying to us about

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.040
the shape of the earth is

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.440
the height of

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.269
conspiracy theories.

00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:55.000
In order

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.220
for this to be true,

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.499
the literally hundreds of

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.660
thousands of people who at some point

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.340
over the last

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.429
50 or 60, 60 years

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:12.460
would have to have to be somewhat complicit in this and

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.320
Nobody spills the beans at all is on the face of it

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.140
completely unbelievable.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.220
The private does not know what the general is doing

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.480
There's compartmentalization happening all the time

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:27.980
(Of course)

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.780
So it wouldn't be that far-fetched

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.240
has the government ever lied to us is really the question at stake.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.100
We all agree on that

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.080
Now we have nasa.gov

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.300
Right and we-

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.280
Oh absolutely they're not lying about anything

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.480
they're completely transparent everything is true.

00:23:45.489 --> 00:23:47.489
We'd be foolish to think that's true

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.990
I'm sorry

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.950
This is a fallacy here.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.450
I'm sure it is-

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:56.280
you were talking about the government.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.939
Now you're talking about an

00:23:57.939 --> 00:23:59.330
NASA-dot-GOV

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.949
But this agency is scrutinized

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.040
By thousands and thousands of scientists

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.400
around the globe.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.351
You are dealing with smart people.

00:24:10.351 --> 00:24:11.499
Believe me you are--

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.440
I don't deny that.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.654
So it is very hard to do that once or twice. Maybe,

00:24:16.654 --> 00:24:18.040
not for the whole time

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.519
What is the proof

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:26.889
hundreds and hundreds of pounds of moon rocks and dust,

00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:28.699
and we have distributed those

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.420
freely to PhD scientists around the world

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.520
and not one of those geologists have said

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.060
What is this ??

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:37.900
They're proven to be fake

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.449
Collected on the ice in Antarctica and the Arctic as well

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.769
There's also collected that you don't have to go to the moon to get moon rocks as a matter of fact all

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.780
US Air Force photography prior to 1958

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.759
shows a Flat Earth only NASA shows us

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:54.759
That is not true, that is absloutely not true

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.570
NASA is lying to you my friend

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.395
Not myself.

00:25:00.395 --> 00:25:02.480
We have a laser retroreflector

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.329
On the moon that we're using now

00:25:05.429 --> 00:25:09.589
We still use to this day you it's sitting there you can find to the inch

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.781
How far away the moon is

00:25:10.781 --> 00:25:11.842
No pictures of home.

00:25:11.842 --> 00:25:13.009
That only is there but

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:15.419
My question to you is

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:20.300
Why? Why would all these honest hard-working people

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.733
perpetuate this massive fraud?

00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:26.920
Why would they do this?

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.000
What's the benefit of it ?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.620
The benefit of it they make fifty two million dollars a day.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.520
Follow the money.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.570
No, the little guy-- the little guy-

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:34.600
That's one thing.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.683
When you say all--

00:25:35.683 --> 00:25:37.321
It didn't start out that way,

00:25:37.321 --> 00:25:39.734
and NASA I was not founded to proof the earth was a globe

00:25:39.734 --> 00:25:41.809
it had nothing to do with the way they were found

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:43.146
Are you sure?

00:25:43.146 --> 00:25:43.900
Yeah positive.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.440
Really?

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.120
Yes

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.140
Somebody has to be a voice for reason and somebody has to be a voice for truth

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.849
It's it would be a fantasy to believe that I would change anybody's mind from the other three

00:25:55.849 --> 00:26:01.000
However, if there's somebody sitting on the fence and this is the first introduction to this debate

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.093
Perhaps they'll hear the reasonable voice and say

00:26:04.093 --> 00:26:07.540
that makes more sense than having this pizza shaped earth.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.120
I used to be a ball Earther.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.780
Everything you say

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.600
right now

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.520
is completely what I used to agree to.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.880
So I completely understand where you're coming from

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.070
For me,

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.500
I think the the correct way to do any kind of

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.820
investigation or to examine things

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.620
is by literally putting yourself in that mindset of the other person.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.740
So I do do that.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.160
I disagree with your position,

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.780
but I completely understand from your perspective what you're saying.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.580
The trouble I have

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.220
understanding your perspective is

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.620
in the modern world

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:06.860
unless you live in a cave somewhere you have to believe in science

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:07.860
implicitly.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.950
I met a flat earther, a young woman who said

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.520
I don't trust anything that science does and

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.510
that's a problem because human beings can't replicate the whole body of science

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.500
every single generation.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.260
At some point you have to trust

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.580
What's already been discovered and proven and move on to the next thing.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.979
Otherwise, we're not going to advance at all.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.599
I mean when you turn that key ignition in your car you expect the car to

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.870
start out and not blow up and not blow up because

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.370
Science put you in that position

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.370
So it's really hard to

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.200
understand how people

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.799
Would know in their hearts that science

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.060
Achieves wonderful things and then just

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.664
jumping ship when it comes to this other issue.

00:27:54.664 --> 00:27:56.270
We're not drawing conclusions

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.120
We understand the mechanisms that made that car work

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.347
There is no theories and no

00:28:01.347 --> 00:28:04.820
no disputed conclusions involved there.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.169
It's not a good analogy

00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:11.418
Can I admit a great compromise that we have to experience being against the grain people?

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:17.267
We have to literally sit in a group and decide whether or not we can afford to have an opinion

00:28:17.267 --> 00:28:18.799
and that's-- that's tough.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.660
Actually, I- I agree with you there because we're the same thing

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.380
I mean, I think skeptics go through this

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.280
and atheists go through this.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.000
I don't believe in God.

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:30.580
When I'm around religious people

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.580
I take a chance

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.800
socially when I tell them I'm an atheist

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.360
so I know it takes some courage to follow your beliefs

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.320
and I appreciate that.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.500
But I think I've done a lot of research in that

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.417
Venue too and it's not something I choose to believe in.

00:28:47.417 --> 00:28:50.499
It's something I have to believe in based on the evidence.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.900
See what I get from you guys is that seeing is believing.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.950
So, how come you believe in God or Jesus? You haven't seen?

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:58.920
Neither of them right?

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.420
I've seen evidence though.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.710
Well exactly. So we are looking for evidence

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.859
There are many many other evidences

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.560
For earth not being flat

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.099
My point is that these are these experiments

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:17.500
Clearly show that the earth is globe and you don't need to go outside the globe to see it's a globe

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.990
It's a conclusion. You told me you want the evidence.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.220
if you're saying that you look only to see something

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.580
then I dispute your belief system in God and Jesus or

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.840
Jehovah or Buddha or Azeris Torah, or anyone.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.300
You keep going back to religion as being our conclusion

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:38.000
Because it's coming from you-- You think you do have the truth

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.040
You quoted at the beginning of this, you quoted the Bible.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.900
Of course I did,

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.940
but that is not the only reason I know what the shape of the earth is.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.180
And you keep -- That's fallacy.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.936
That's not fallacy.

00:29:49.936 --> 00:29:51.550
Actually, it is not fallacy

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.540
It is a fallacy.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.860
I'm a Theoretical physicist

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.280
What I'm doing is

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.000
the combination of string theory and cosmology.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.600
So we try to understand what happened

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.820
during the Big Bang,

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.060
after the Big Bang

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.100
or even before the Big Bang.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:18.140
Well, I hope I would be able particularly to the young generation

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:25.080
To convince them that first they should think critically and don't believe anything. They shouldn't take anything for granted

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.660
Look at the evidences and examine those evidences and

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.320
throw away

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.620
Those claims that are not evidenced base.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.390
Science

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:44.000
not to put it down, but when you're talking about rocket science

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:50.900
This is very difficult for the majority of people to understand and it's designed that way and

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:53.370
So in a lot of ways

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:54.910
hiding behind

00:30:54.910 --> 00:31:01.740
Rocket science is similar to religion if you look at the Catholic Church back in the days only we can interpret the Bible you have

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.190
To listen to what we say

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.350
So in a lot of ways

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:10.980
We're getting that same notion from science that says only we can interpret what these numbers are

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.440
You just need to trust us.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.039
But then when we actually do go and test some of their equations and they don't work

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:21.100
Does that beg the question for us to go and test it ourself? Absolutely.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:27.320
I would say, you know one great thing about science is its predictability.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:33.990
Let's form some moment for a short moment assume that your model. This Flat Earth model is correct. I don't know

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:37.259
What does it buy for us? What does what does it predict for us?

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.870
So my question for you guys

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:41.800
would be

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.630
next time

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:49.950
Bring me something from your theory your model that you can predict something which the globe earth

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.759
Model cannot predict then I would change my mind

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.970
And we just say that don't believe

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.490
anything that I've said

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.819
You got to do your own research and I think what you'll find is that

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:07.860
You'll see that a puzzle piece doesn't fit and the only way you're going to do that is if you put your own eyeballs on it.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.175
I don't blame people for being skeptical.

00:32:10.175 --> 00:32:13.620
I'm skeptical about a lot of different things. I applaud that

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.020
instinct in you, but you have to go beyond just

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:23.520
Not believing in something, ask the hard questions

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.880
Ask what qualifies a YouTuber or a book author?

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.360
Anywhere else you're getting this information

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.220
What qualifies them to make wide-ranging?

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.820
Comments about the shape of the earth.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.840
Look anybody who can overturn Einstein or some major theory is going to be eventually

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:52.020
written in the halls of science for the rest of their lives, but they have to come up with the goods they have to show

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.980
Good science-based evidence that what they say is true and they have to withstand

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.180
the test of time and peer review and the rigors of the scientific method.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:19.520
Thank you guys for watching this episode of middle ground that's right

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.339
We know that one of the biggest requests we get is we just want longer episodes

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.730
We wanna know more about these stories. We want to hear more about the middle ground

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:31.559
So, we created a podcast called 'Radical Empathy' where we can do just that

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.309
Shelly from this episode actually sat down with me and we had a conversation

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.599
About her beliefs and how she came to be a flat earther. It's amazing

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.490
You have to listen to it, but don't just take our word for it. We're gonna play you a little sample right now. All right

00:33:46.659 --> 00:33:51.539
This is John Regalado sitting with Shelly Lewis, and we are here to talk about

00:33:52.539 --> 00:33:53.564
Beliefs.

00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:54.460
Okay.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:59.699
I have studied that the earth is flat. Mmm, and I've come to the conclusion that I agree with that;

00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:04.109
This episode is amazing. There's our first one ever and you can find it anywhere

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.490
You can spot mine and Spotify an apple stitcher wherever you listen to podcasts, but if you love it

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:11.760
Please let us know in the comments there and also give it five stars

00:34:12.369 --> 00:34:15.599
Because if yours loved it, we're gonna do even more this is just a big test

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.039
Yeah, we'd love to do a whole season of these for you guys. So thank you so much for supporting us

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.529
We want to keep making new things for you and until next time
